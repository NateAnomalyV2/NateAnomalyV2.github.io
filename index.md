I am a computer science student at SCUF and I expect to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite SPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 8, part 1 & 2
  This lab was the first and was challenging because we worked on for-loops for the first time. It was enjoyable to learn how to do that for future labs. My partner and I worked together to make the perfect sandwich by following the steps to make the program run, and the result was “A PROTEIN sandwich on BREAD with CONDIMENT.” 

* Lab 10
  This lab was fun to do because it involved finding if the numbers in the program were prime numbers, and we would do this through the for-loops we created. This was a satisfying lab because it took everything we learned from the previous labs and forced us to use it for this one with our partners, and when it was completed, I was glad that I learned everything.

* Lab 11 
  This lab was one of my favorites because even though it wasn’t challenging compared to others, it was fun to do because I was able to code the calories for different pizzas through loops and make it appear in the output correctly without being stressed that I didn’t know what some parts meant and I was able to complete it with my partner.
